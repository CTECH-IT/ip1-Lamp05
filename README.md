Hello! 

This is my game, "INTERCEPT". The goal of the game is to reach level 10 with as many points as possible. To progress through levels, you have to block a cube from hitting the bottom of the screen. The catch is that the cube gets faster with each level. There are power-ups that give you extra lives, but they detract from your score.
